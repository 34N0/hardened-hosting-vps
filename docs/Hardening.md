# ‚õëÔ∏è Hardening Ubuntu Server

## ü™Ç CIS Security Compliance

Make sure you read the [CIS Benchmark](CIS_Ubuntu_Linux_22.04_LTS_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf) first.

To achieve CIS Level 2 Compliance attach the machine to [Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro/tutorial) and follow the instructions on [CIS setup](https://ubuntu.com/security/certifications/docs/usg/cis).

after you followed the documentation you should audit the system:
```bash
sudo usg audit cis_level2_server
```
copy the report to host user home, make host the owner and download with:
```bash
scp -P <port> host@<hostname>:~/usg-report-<...>.html .
```

## üè¥ Without Ubuntu PRO

Alternativelly this repository contains the script [cis-level2-server.sh](../scripts/cis-level2-server.sh) which automates fixing compliance issues without having a Ubuntu Server subscription. This is not recommended since you loose the audit capabilities. Running this script blind is a bad idea so make sure you understand what it does!

## üì± SSH

Additional SSH Configuration which is not part of CIS Level 2:

1. Open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

2. Set the following:
custom port:
```bash
Port <port_number>
```
(assuming you're using key auth) disable passwort auth:
```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
```
3. restart sshd
```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

### 2FA

Follow this [Digital Ocean Guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-ssh-on-ubuntu-20-04).

## Firewall

The CIS Standard creates a file in ```/etc/nftables.rules```. Load the file with:
```bash
nft -f /etc/nftables.rules
```
This repository contains an [updated configuration](../templates/nftables.rules.template) file allowing a specified SSH port, Http & Https.
